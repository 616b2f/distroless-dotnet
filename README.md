# ATTENTION! please consider to use "Chiseled" official equivalent for distroless image, made by Microsoft and Canonical [see this blogpost for more infos](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-is-now-in-ubuntu-2204/#net-in-chiseled-ubuntu-containers) 
Chiseled is smaller and comes with official support, because of this I will archive this repo in near future.
